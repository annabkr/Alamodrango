# Alamodrango

Web scraper bot that sends text messages when Alamo Drafthouse posts new movie showtimes. I'm an Alamo Drafthouse superfan, I have the second to highest tier of their membership level and everything. Got tired of refreshing the page every hour on Mondays/Tuesdays when they update the listings, so I decided to make a bot to do it for me, and learn Golang in the process.

Work in progress.
