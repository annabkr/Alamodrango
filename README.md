# Alamodrango

Web scraper bot that sends text messages when Alamo Drafthouse posts new movie showtimes. 

I'm an Alamo Drafthouse superfan, and I got tired of refreshing the page every hour on Mondays/Tuesdays when they update the listings, so I decided to make a bot to do it for me, and learn Golang in the process.

Text-messaging using Twilio's REST API and web scraping have been fully implemented. Currently working on automation.
